        <div class="collapse-title text-4xl font-medium capitalize">What is the document object model (DOM)?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="text-2xl">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents a web page as a tree structure of nodes and objects.
            It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
            A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="text-2xl">JavaScript provides several methods to select DOM elements. Here are some of them: <br>
            1.Using getElementById <br>
            2.Using getElementsByClassName <br>
            3.Using getElementsByTagName <br>
            4.Using querySelector <br>
            5.Using querySelectorAll

        <div class="collapse-title text-4xl font-medium">What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it useful?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="text-2xl">Event delegation in the DOM is a technique that allows a single event listener to be attached to a parent element to handle events for all of its child elements. 
            Event Delegation is a pattern based upon the concept of Event Bubbling. It is an event-handling pattern that allows you to handle events at a higher level in the DOM tree other than the level where the event was first received. <br>A Brief Intro to Event Propagation
            By default, events triggered on an element propagate up the DOM tree to the element's parent, its ancestors, and on up until the root element (html). <br>
            This is useful because it can improve performance and simplify event handling, especially when dealing with dynamically generated content.

        <div class="collapse-title text-4xl font-medium">How do you manipulated an element's attributes and styles using the DOM?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="text-2xl">Manipulating Element Attributes
            The classList object only provide methods to change the class of an element. If you want to change other attributes like id, href, or src, you can use the setAttribute() method.
            
            The setAttribute() method accepts two arguments: <br>
            1.The name of the attribute to set <br>
            2.The value of the attribute to set
